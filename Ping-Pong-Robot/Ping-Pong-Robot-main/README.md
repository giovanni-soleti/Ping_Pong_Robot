# Ping-Pong-Robot
Kinematics and Dynamics of Ping Pong Robot simulated and analized with Matlab.

1. Run OutgoingTrajectory_RebounModel.m to read analysis of hit between the Racket and the Ball;
2. Load last data and run DeltaRobot.m to simulate the Robot (has been used Delta Robot) motion from Inverse Kinematic;
3. Run LoadTorqueAnalysis.m to see how we study Dynamic of the Robot and which Torque request by the actuators.
